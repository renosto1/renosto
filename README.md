# My Repository

In this repository, I share the code from many small apps I've developed to solidify the concepts I have been acquiring during my coding studies and through the pursuit of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing with Specialization in Software Development at the National College of Ireland.

## Apps

#### House Plants Classes

Application that uses inheritance and 3 classes (a superclass, a subclass and an app class) that implements an object of the subclass. For instance: House Plant > Orchid > specific plant objetct.
Exercise to understand Java syntax, classes, superclass, subclass, composition, inheritance, objects.
<br>
<br>

#### Largest Number from Array

Application generates a randon array of numbers and chooses the largest number from that array.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, arrays, for loop, Math.random class, util.Arrays utility class, objects, instantiable classes.
<br>
<br>

#### Mean and Sum of Array

Application return the mean and sum of an array of numbers.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, arrays, for loop, objects, instantiable classes.
<br>
<br>


#### Guess Number

Guessing game where the computer comes up with a random number and the user guesses, the app output if the user is the winner or loser.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, for loop, if statements, Math.random class, JOptionPane class library for input and output.
<br>
<br>


#### Average Grade

Application that asks the user to input how many subjects they take and what marks (0-100) they got in each subject. The app output their average result and the grade from A-F based on their results.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, for loop, if statements, double methods, JOptionPane class library for input and output, code documentation.
<br>
<br>

#### Blood Type 

Application that request user to insert age and blood typed and display a message outlining which blood groups the user can donate to and receive from.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, objects, instantiable classes, conditions, if statements, strings concatenation, string methods, , JOptionPane class library for input and output.
<br>
<br>

#### Odd or Even Number

Application that takes in a number from a user and outputs whether it is odd or even.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, objects, conditions, if statements, variables, modulo operator, JOptionPane class library for input and output.
<br>
<br>

#### Psotive or Negative Number

Application that takes in a number from a user and outputs whether it is positive or negative.
Basic exercise to understand Java syntax, conditions, if statements, variables, JOptionPane class library for input and output.
